# from the project root
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

This repository contains:

## Mobile / Touch

- The game is responsive and will scale to fit mobile screens.
- Tap the screen to jump. Touch near the bottom of the screen to duck.
- If things look small, open the page in the browser and rotate the device to landscape for a wider play area.

To test locally, open `index.html` on your phone (or use your desktop browser's device toolbar).
